# nugatoria
Nugatoria is designed as an app for creating, storing, and organizing notes
The actual application does not yet exist, but the database behind it does.
For Boston University MET CS 699 I spent six weeks designing the relational database behind the app. The resulting code is in this repository, along with my project write-up that discusses the design at length.
